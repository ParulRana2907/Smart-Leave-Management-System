Parul Rana (24CSU292), I took primary responsibility for file handling and persistent data storage, ensuring smooth saving and retrieval of records. I managed
arrays of objects for both users and leave requests, and organized the official project documentation (including the comprehensive report). I prepared and
designed the project PowerPoint presentation, formatted all UI text and tables for clarity and professionalism, created sample input/output screens for
demonstration, and contributed significantly to functionality testing and quality assurance.

Shubhangi Tyagi (24CSU294), She led the overall system architecture and was responsible for designing the core class structure, implementing constructors, and
establishing the package organization. She managed the main control flow, developed menu navigation logic, and implemented advanced features including robust
exception handling, the blockchain-inspired audit logging mechanism, and data export functionality (CSV/TXT).

Additionally, we both handled bug fixing, full-system integration, and complete feature testing to ensure a reliable, user-friendly application.

**📌 Future Scope**
